# uwu-cpp
A simple, interactive command-line uwu translator. Includes the simple uwu library for third party use.

## why?
This is only a project to recall the basic programming fundamentals for C++. Also, because why not? the world needs more uwus.
To use this in any of your C++ projects, just include the uwulib.h file. See below for usage of the library.

## any features?
The translator only converts the letters 'l' and 'r' to the letter 'w', as well as any words that have 'mo' and 'no' to 'myo-' and 'nyo-'.
Also, who dares to forget the 'uwu' at the end!?

## sounds cool! sign me up!
Just clone this repository to your local device and compile it with a C++ compiler of your choice!

## uwulib.h: how do you use this?
Just call the `uwu::translate()` method, passing in a `std::string` as an argument.
